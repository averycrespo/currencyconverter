# currencyconverter
Simple currency converter (command line) that takes 10 of the most common currencies and converts to the option you select.
Input uses 0-9 to select which currency you would like.
Since exchange rates vary everyday I decided use a constant exchange rate from when I searched up the exchange rates online.
